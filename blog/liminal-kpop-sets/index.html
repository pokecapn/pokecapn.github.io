<p>so every morning I head over to <a href="https://reddit.com/r/liminalspace">r/liminalspace</a> and pick my new Zoom background for the day. this serves as a nice mini-ritual to start work and makes meetings ever so slightly more fun. I've been doing this, although not always with that subreddit, for something like 5 and a half years at this point. that is a <em>lot</em> of &quot;liminal spaces&quot; i've exposed myself to.</p>
<p>there is much argument over what is and isn't a liminal space, but since I just find it really funny that people experience spiritual levels of emotion to a picture of an empty hotel lobby with the elevator open, I'm don't really sweat the details. I think as long as you get the sense that you're alone, and either moving from point A to point B or taking a pit stop somewhere uselessly detached from society, that's a liminal space.</p>
<p>all of which leads me to a brilliant brainstorm I had in the middle of the night in 2021, when I was re-watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CTGxKIzD7M">Pristin V's Get It</a> (as you do) and there was this second-long shot of an empty room with a nonsense hexagonal couch, fluorescent lighting, and a bunch of mirrors going nowhere. that's when I realized that in the quest for hyper-stimulating visuals, kpop music videos end up churning out insane liminal spaces as set pieces. normally you don't pick up on it because <em>someone</em> is almost always there <em>on the set</em>, interrupting the liminality, but I cracked the code.</p>
<p>so I made a tweet with that shot, another shot from the same MV, and a couple more I had remembered or thought I remembered from other MVs. I had a followup ready to go in the afternoon to get more eyeballs on it because I thought it was really good. and then, I kept going. it was now just the secondary game I play of &quot;find the liminal spaces&quot; whenever I watch music videos or their behinds. appending to the thread every two weeks or so, I've now hit about 300 kpop liminal spaces.</p>
<p>with Twitter dead, I've decided to keep the thread going on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chambraigne.com/post/3l7jzwjq3qh2t">Bluesky</a>, but I also collected the whole thing in this imgur gallery that hopefully I'll remember to keep updated. these images are pokecapn-approved for your own Zoom backgrounds, or for any time you need to zone out and drift between realities:</p>
